// This module is now deprecated and its functionality has been moved directly into the Zustand store (`store.ts`) as actions.
// This was done to resolve a critical circular dependency issue that was preventing the application from loading.
// This file is kept temporarily for architectural reference and will be removed in a future version.

export {}; // Ensures this file is treated as a module.
